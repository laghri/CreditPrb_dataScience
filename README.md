# Credit Data Science Problem

A problem in credit data science involves training a machine learning model to predict credit risk based on loan applicant characteristics. This project aims to solve this problem using Python programming language and various libraries such as scikit-learn (sklearn), pandas, and numpy.



## Requirements
### les packages
-import pandas as pd
-import numpy as np
-import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
-import seaborn as sns 
-from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
-from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit

-from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
-from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
-from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

-from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
-import pickle


- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Steps

1. Acquire and clean the data
2. Perform exploratory data analysis
3. Engineer new features
4. Train a machine learning model
5. Evaluate the model performance
6. Deploy the model in a production environment

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and install the required libraries. Then follow the steps outlined in the code to train your own credit risk prediction model.
